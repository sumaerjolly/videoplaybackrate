# Video Playback Rate Chrome Extension

Playing around to see how much I can do using ChatGPT (GPT-4).
This is a simple Chrome extension that allows you to control the playback rate of HTML5 videos on a webpage. The extension was developed using only ChatGPT (GPT-4) by OpenAI, without ever having built a Chrome extension or even referring to the Chrome documentation. It demonstrates the capabilities of AI assistance in software development.

## Features

- Detects all HTML5 videos on the current webpage
- Allows you to select a video from a dropdown list
- Provides a slider to control the playback rate (speed) of the selected video
- Maintains the playback rate of individual videos when switching between them
